Notes on Ridgerunner logging and file behavior.

A RR run will create a subdirectory of the current directory with the name

basename.rr

In this directory is stored several files:

basename.vect                  The original file without any modifications.
basename.atstart.vect	       The file after autoscaling, reresing, and eqing.
rrlog.dat                      Basic data collection for the run (updated during run).
basename.final.vect            The current state of the link (updated during run).
basename.final.struts          The struts, saved from octrope.

A subdirectory

logfiles

stores a large array of logfiles containing different information about the run

length.dat
ropelength.dat
strutcount.dat
stepsize.dat
thickness.dat
minrad.dat
residual.dat
maxovermin.dat
rcond.dat
walltime.dat
maxvertforce.dat
convergence.dat
edgelenvariance.dat

The names and numbers of the logfiles are stored in
state.logfilenames[] and the actual filehandles are in
state.logfiles[]. The logfiles are enumerated in the type GraphTypes
in stepper.h.

If suppressfiles is not on, we also store intermediate steps in the
subdirectory

vectfiles            

basename.000001.vect

basename.nnnnnn.vect
